I would treat the problem as a supervised machine learning task where incoming emails are classified into categories like \"Important,\" \"Normal,\" \"Social,\"  and \"Promotional/Spam.\" This classification would rely on features extracted from the email content and metadata. Additionally, I might explore natural language processing techniques to understand the semantics of email content better. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately assign a priority level to each new email.\n",

        "**Data Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "I would require a substantial dataset of historical emails. This dataset needs to include the full email content (subject, body, sender, recipients, timestamps, and attachments metadata). However, each email must be labeled with its true priority category (e.g., manually labeled by users or inferred from user actions like \"replied immediately\" vs. \"deleted\"). I'd also need metadata like sender domain reputation and user interaction history (e.g., historical open/reply rates for specific senders).\n",

        "**Data Collection:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Data collection would involve extracting emails and their associated metadata from the company's email server or an archiving system. For labeling, I would need to implement a system where employees can explicitly tag emails with their priority, or I could infer priority based on their subsequent actions (e.g., immediate replies, moving to a \"critical\" folder). This labeling process would be crucial for creating the ground truth for our supervised learning model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Understanding and Preparation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "First, I would conduct extensive Exploratory Data Analysis to understand email volume, sender distributions, and initial content patterns. Data preparation would involve cleaning email content by removing HTML tags, stop words, and special characters, followed by tokenization and lemmatization. I would then engineer features such as email length, presence of urgent keywords, number of attachments, sender's historical interaction score, and domain reputation. Finally, the textual content would be transformed into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings, ready for modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Modeling and Evaluation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For modeling, I would start with simpler classification algorithms like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes as baselines. I would then move to more sophisticated models such as Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost) for better performance on text data. The models would be trained on the prepared dataset, and their performance would be evaluated using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy, paying close attention to the recall of \"Critical\" emails to minimize false negatives. I would also use cross-validation to ensure model robustness."
